# Matlab Image Processing

This repo contains matlab codes for various image processing techniques studied as a part of on-campus Pattern Recognition (BITS F446) course. It also contains the solutions of the two assignments conducted during the course. The image processing techniques implemented from scratch are:

1. Blurring an Image using Averaging Mask
2. Global Thresholding an Image
3. Taking Gamma Transform of an Image
4. Bit-Plane Slicing of an Image
5. Histogram Equalization for better contrast Image
6. Median Filtering to remove Salt-pepper Noise
7. Laplacian of an Image for Edge Detection
8. Weighted averaging mask run on an Image to produce slight Blurring Effect
9. Perform Dilation on an Image using a Square Strel
10. Perform Erosion on an Image using a Square Strel
11. Hit-Miss Transformation
12. Boundary Extraction
13. End Point Detection
14. Automatic Global Thresholding
15. Find all Connected Components in an Image
16. Compute Gradient of an Image
17. Assignment_1 - Thresholding
18. Assignment_2 - Hough Transformation

Each of the sub-folders in this repo contain a `.m` matlab script. You can run a script (let's say `connected_components.m`) using the following command:
```sh
run connected_components.m
```

A summary of all code can be found in `Matlab_Code_Summary.pdf`.
